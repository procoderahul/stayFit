Hi everyone. This is my new project. You need to follow the following steps to make it work on your system:

1. Clone the project to your code editor.
2. Go to the desired folder.
3. Just write the command: "npm install". This will install all the required packages and tech stacks needed.
4. Now you can run the project.

Thank you....
